This VB.Net project uses the Crystal Reports SDK to rapidly generate an XML representation of a report's object hierarchy.

Enhancements:
  * Create an XSD document to validate XML definition
  * Reconstitute a Crystal Reports document from its XML definition
  * Develop XSL Transformations to leverage the XML definition.  For example, extract all database tables, Command text, and SQL Expressions
  * Use Reflection to process the report's object hierarchy

Alpha 0.0.0:
**Chart, Picture, and Map details (among others) are not supported by the .Net SDK**

C# version: [RptToXml](https://github.com/ajryan/RptToXml)
